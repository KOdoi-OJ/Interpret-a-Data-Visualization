# Project Description: Interpret a Data Visualization
This is the 1st project in Udacity's Business Analytics Nanodegree

In this project, a visualization was given for the student to derive any three (3) insights.
Each insight was to be described, and the source of the insight stated and backed with a visual as can be seen from the Final Submission.

The objective was to assess the student's ability to analyze visualizations, derive insights, and explain them.
